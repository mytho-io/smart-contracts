## Overview

The **MYTHO Ecosystem** is a comprehensive decentralized platform built on Soneium that combines governance tokens, community engagement, and content creation. The ecosystem centers around **totems** - community-driven tokens that users can create, trade, and engage with through various mechanisms.

### Core Concept
- **Totems**: Community tokens (ERC20/ERC721) that represent different communities or projects
- **Merit System**: Users earn merit points through engagement, which are converted to MYTHO token rewards
- **Community Posts**: Decentralized content platform where posts are NFTs that can be boosted and rewarded
- **Daily Engagement**: Streak-based boost system encouraging consistent participation with achievement badges

The platform features cross-chain functionality via Chainlink's CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol), allowing the MYTHO token to operate seamlessly across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Soneium, and Astar networks.

### Latest Additions (Under Audit)
The ecosystem has recently expanded with four major new contracts that enhance user engagement and create new reward mechanisms:
- **BoostSystem**: Daily engagement with streak rewards and VRF-powered premium boosts
- **Posts**: Community content platform with NFT posts and SHARD token rewards
- **BadgeNFT**: Achievement system with collectible milestone badges
- **Shards**: Dedicated reward token for the posts ecosystem

### Key Features

- **MYTHO Token**: ERC20 governance token with a fixed supply cap of 1 billion tokens, featuring mint-on-demand distribution with supply cap enforcement to support cross-chain burn/mint mechanisms.
- **Merit System**: Users earn merit points for their totems, which are boosted during special "Mythum" periods, and can claim MYTHO rewards based on accumulated merit.
- **Advanced Boost System**: Daily engagement mechanism with streak rewards, grace days, achievement badges, and Chainlink VRF-powered premium boosts with random reward distribution.
- **Community Posts Platform**: Decentralized content system where posts are ERC721 NFTs with boosting mechanics, SHARD token rewards, native token donations, and creator royalties.
- **Achievement Badges**: NFT-based milestone system rewarding consistent engagement with collectible badges for streak achievements (7, 14, 30, 100, 200 days).
- **SHARD Token Economy**: Dedicated ERC20 reward token for the posts ecosystem with mathematical formula-based distribution and ecosystem-wide controls.
- **Totem Creation**: Supports creation of totems with either new tokens or existing whitelisted tokens, with registration after full sale for non-custom tokens.
- **Token Sales**: Users can buy and sell `TotemToken` during the sale period, with liquidity automatically added to UniswapV2-type pool after the sale concludes.
- **Cross-Chain Functionality**: MYTHO tokens can be transferred between supported blockchains using Chainlink's CCIP, with specialized implementations for each chain (standard MYTHO on native chain, BurnMintMYTHO on non-native chains).
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implements comprehensive role-based permissions using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl for secure operations.
- **Security**: Leverages OpenZeppelin libraries for access control, safe transfers, reentrancy protection, and upgradability patterns.

### MYTHO Token Distribution

The MYTHO token has a fixed supply cap of 1 billion tokens with mint-on-demand distribution. The complete allocation plan is as follows:

#### Planned Distribution Breakdown

**MeritManager (Totem Incentives)**: **2%** = **20,000,000 MYTHO**
- Vested over 4 years (implemented at deployment):
  - Year 1: 8,000,000 MYTHO (40% of 20M)
  - Year 2: 6,000,000 MYTHO (30% of 20M)
  - Year 3: 4,000,000 MYTHO (20% of 20M)
  - Year 4: 2,000,000 MYTHO (10% of 20M)

**Soneium & Cross-Chain Rewards**: **48%** = **480,000,000 MYTHO**
- Managed via governance system with timelock and multi-sig security

- Tokens automatically released according to schedule

**ðŸ”„ On-Demand Distribution (98%):**
- **Remaining Supply**: 980 million tokens available for distribution
- Created through `createVesting` function by MULTISIG role
- Subject to governance approval and timelock mechanisms
- Supply cap protection ensures global 1 billion token limit

#### Distribution Mechanism

**Mint-on-Demand Architecture:**
- **Supply Cap Protection**: Total minted amount tracked to ensure 1B token cap across all chains
- **Cross-Chain Safe**: Accounts for burn/mint bridging mechanisms while maintaining supply cap
- **Governance Security**: Large allocations managed via timelock and multi-sig for security
- **Flexible Vesting**: Custom vesting schedules can be created for different allocation purposes

#### Role-Based Access Control
- **MANAGER Role**: Can pause/unpause token transfers
- **MULTISIG Role**: Can create new vesting schedules and mint tokens (subject to supply cap)
- **DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE**: Can manage all roles and permissions
- **Governance System**: Future implementation for managing large allocations with timelock security

### Merit System

The merit system is a core component of the MYTHO ecosystem, rewarding totem holders for their participation:

- **Merit Points**: Earned by totems through various activities and user interactions
- **Mythus Periods**: Special periods where merit points earned are multiplied (default: 1.5x)
- **Boosting**: Users holding totem tokens can boost their totems by paying a fee in native tokens during Mythus periods
- **Rewards Distribution**: MYTHO tokens are distributed to totems proportionally based on their merit points in each period
- **Blacklisting**: Totems can be blacklisted to prevent them from earning or claiming rewards

### Boost System (New Feature)

The **BoostSystem** introduces an advanced daily engagement mechanism with streak rewards and achievement badges:

#### Core Boost Mechanics
- **Free Daily Boosts**: Users can perform one free boost per day (24-hour cooldown) for any totem they hold tokens for
- **Premium Boosts**: Paid boosts using native tokens (ETH) with Chainlink VRF for random reward calculation
- **Signature Verification**: Frontend signature validation prevents unauthorized boost attempts and ensures security
- **Token Requirements**: Minimum token balance required (configurable for ERC20, any balance for ERC721)

#### Streak System & Grace Days
- **Streak Tracking**: Consecutive daily boosts build streaks with increasing reward multipliers (up to 30 days: +5% per day)
- **Grace Days**: Earned through premium boosts and 30-day streak milestones to maintain streaks during missed days
- **Grace Period**: 2x cooldown window (48 hours) before streak breaks, allowing flexibility for users
- **Streak Reset**: Automatic reset when grace days are exhausted and boost window is missed

#### Achievement Badges & Milestones
- **NFT Badges**: ERC721 tokens minted for achieving streak milestones (7, 14, 30, 100, 200 days)
- **Milestone Tracking**: Automatic detection and badge availability when milestones are reached
- **Badge Minting**: Users can mint available badges through the BadgeNFT contract
- **Customizable Metadata**: Milestone-specific URIs for different badge designs

#### VRF Integration & Premium Rewards
- **Chainlink VRF**: Secure randomness for premium boost reward calculation
- **Reward Probabilities**: 
  - 50% chance: 500 points
  - 25% chance: 700 points  
  - 15% chance: 1000 points
  - 7% chance: 2000 points
  - 3% chance: 3000 points
- **Expected Value**: ~805 base points with streak and Mythum multipliers applied

### Posts Ecosystem (New Feature)

The **Posts** system creates a decentralized content platform where community posts are tokenized as NFTs:

#### Post Creation & Management
- **NFT Posts**: Each post is an ERC721 token with royalty functionality (configurable %)
- **Approval Workflow**: Posts from non-creators/collaborators require totem owner approval
- **Metadata Storage**: Posts store content hashes for decentralized content verification
- **Creator Rights**: Automatic approval for totem creators and designated collaborators

#### Post Boosting & Rewards
- **Token Staking**: Users can boost posts by staking totem tokens (ERC20 amounts or ERC721 NFTs)
- **Boost Window**: Limited time window (default: 24 hours) for boosting after post creation
- **Shard Rewards**: Mathematical formula-based SHARD token distribution for boosters and creators
- **Reward Formula**: `S * (l/T) * sqrt(L/T)` where:
  - S = Base shard reward (configurable)
  - l = User's locked tokens
  - L = Total locked tokens for post
  - T = Token circulating supply

#### Donation System
- **Native Token Donations**: Direct ETH donations to post creators
- **Fee Structure**: Configurable donation fee (default: 1%) sent to treasury
- **Merit Integration**: Donations contribute to totem merit points when registered
- **Creator Rewards**: Immediate transfer of donation amount (minus fees) to post creator

#### SHARD Token Economy
- **Reward Token**: ERC20 token specifically for posts ecosystem rewards
- **Minting Control**: Only Posts contract can mint SHARD tokens
- **Burnable**: Users can burn their SHARD tokens if needed
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Respects ecosystem-wide pause functionality

### Totem Creation and Token Sales

The process of creating and selling totems involves several steps:

1. **Totem Creation**: Users can create totems through the TotemFactory, either with a new token or an existing whitelisted token
2. **Sale Period**: During the sale period, users can buy and sell totem tokens through the TotemTokenDistributor
3. **Sale Closure**: When all available tokens are sold (excluding those reserved for liquidity), the sale period ends
4. **Liquidity Addition**: A portion of the collected payment tokens and totem tokens are added to a UniswapV2-type liquidity pool
5. **Distribution**: Collected payment tokens are distributed according to predefined shares:
   - Revenue share (treasury): 2.5%
   - Creator share: 0.5%
   - Pool share (liquidity): 28.57%
   - Vault share (totem contract): 68.43%
6. **Token Burning**: After the sale period, totem token holders can burn their tokens to receive proportional shares of payment tokens, MYTHO tokens, and LP tokens

### Cross-Chain Functionality

The MYTHO ecosystem supports cross-chain operations using Chainlink's CCIP:

- **Native Chain**: Uses the standard MYTHO token with LockReleaseTokenPool for CCIP integration
- **Non-Native Chains**: Uses BurnMintMYTHO with BurnMintTokenPool for CCIP integration
- **Supply Cap Management**: The native chain tracks total minted amount to maintain global supply cap across all chains
- **Token Transfer**: Users can transfer MYTHO tokens between supported chains by:
  1. Approving the token for the source chain's token pool
  2. Initiating a transfer through the CCIP router
  3. Receiving tokens on the destination chain through minting (for non-native chains) or release (for native chain)
- **Security**: Implements access control for minting and burning operations, with only authorized CCIP pools able to mint or burn tokens

## Security Features

The MYTHO ecosystem implements several security features:

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Uses OpenZeppelin's AccessControl for granular role-based permissions
- **Supply Cap Enforcement**: Tracks total minted amount to prevent exceeding 1 billion token global cap
- **Pausable Functionality**: MANAGER role can pause contracts in emergency situations
- **Ecosystem-Wide Pause**: AddressRegistry provides a central mechanism to pause the entire ecosystem
- **Safe Transfers**: Uses SafeERC20 for token transfers to prevent common vulnerabilities
- **Upgradability**: Implements the upgradable pattern for all core contracts to allow for future improvements
- **Cross-Chain Safety**: Mint-on-demand design prevents supply inflation during cross-chain operations

### Additional Security Features (New Contracts)

- **Signature Verification**: BoostSystem uses ECDSA signature verification with replay attack protection and time-based validity windows
- **VRF Integration**: Chainlink VRF provides secure randomness for premium boost rewards, preventing manipulation
- **Reentrancy Protection**: All state-changing functions use OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
- **Oracle Data Validation**: Posts contract validates TokenHoldersOracle data freshness for NFT-based calculations
- **Mathematical Safety**: Reward calculations use OpenZeppelin's Math library with overflow protection and precision handling
- **Token Staking Security**: Posts contract safely handles both ERC20 and ERC721 token staking with proper balance checks
- **Grace Day Mechanics**: BoostSystem implements secure grace day tracking to prevent streak manipulation
- **Milestone Validation**: BadgeNFT ensures only valid milestones can be achieved and prevents duplicate badge minting
- **Fee Collection Safety**: Native token handling uses Address.sendValue for secure ETH transfers
- **Access Control Inheritance**: All new contracts inherit comprehensive role-based permissions from core ecosystem
