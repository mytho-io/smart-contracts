## Overview

The next iteration of the **MYTHO platform** introduces the **Layer Creation and Engagement System**, a dynamic framework designed to empower authors and foster community interaction through unique digital assets and rewards.

## Key Features

### 1. Layer Creation
- **What are Layers?**
  - Unique NFTs (images, GIFs, text, or links) tied to **Totems**, minted as **ERC721 tokens**.
- **Publishing Process**:
  - **Totem Creators or Collaborators**: Can publish layers automatically.
  - **Totem Holders**: Can submit layers, but these require approval and are marked as **verified** in the smart contract.

### 2. Shards: Activity Token
- **What are Shards?**
  - A new, **transferable**, and **burnable** token earned through layer creation and engagement.
  - Used for privileges like badges or staking boosts.
- **Earning Shards**:
  - **Creating Layers**: Authors earn Shards for publishing layers.
  - **Boosting Layers**: Users lock **Totem tokens** for 24 hours to increase a layer’s visibility, earning Shards based on:
    - Their token share.
    - Engagement level.
  - **Shard Distribution**:
    - **Authors**: Receive **10% of boosters’ Shards** or a minimum of **50 Shards**.
    - **Boosters**: Earn Shards proportional to their contribution and engagement.

### 3. Totem Rankings
- **Merit Points**:
  - Totems earn **Merit Points** for each published layer.
  - Higher Merit Points improve a Totem’s ranking within the MYTHO ecosystem.

### 4. Author Incentives
- **Revenue Streams**:
  - **NFT Sales**: Direct sales of layer NFTs.
  - **Royalties**: Earnings from secondary market transactions.
  - **Donations**: Community support for high-quality content.
- **Benefits**:
  - Authors are rewarded for creating engaging, high-quality layers, driving further content creation.

### 5. Community Engagement
- **Positive Feedback Loop**:
  - The system incentivizes **quality content** and **active participation** through Shards, Merit Points, and financial rewards.
  - Encourages collaboration between creators, holders, and boosters.

### 6. Moderation and Penalties
- **Totem Admins**:
  - Responsible for maintaining platform standards.
  - **Penalties** apply for violating moderation policies to ensure a fair and safe ecosystem.

## Summary
The MYTHO Layer Creation and Engagement System transforms content creation into a rewarding, community-driven experience. By integrating **NFTs**, **Shards**, and **Merit Points**, it fosters a vibrant ecosystem where creators and participants are incentivized to produce and promote high-quality content while maintaining a balanced and moderated platform.
